# KMP Game Explorer - Implementation Strategy

## Project Overview

The KMP Game Explorer is a cross-platform application built with Compose Multiplatform that allows
users to explore video games, genres, developers, and publishers using the RAWG Video Game Database
API. The app supports Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web platforms.

## Current Project Status

The project has a solid foundation with:

1. Basic KMP setup for multiple platforms
2. Initial RAWG API integration with some endpoints
3. Basic UI components and screens (Home and Game Details)
4. Navigation using PreCompose
5. Some game models and repository implementation

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features

**Feature Branches:**

- Format: `feature/phase-{phase-number}/{feature-name}`
- Example: `feature/phase-3/game-list-view`

**Hotfix Branches:**

- Format: `hotfix/{issue-description}`
- Example: `hotfix/image-loading-crash`

**Release Branches:**

- Format: `release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`

## Missing RAWG API Endpoints to Implement

Based on the current implementation and the RAWG API documentation, here are the endpoints we need
to implement:

1. **Genres API**
    - `GET /genres` - List all genres
    - `GET /genres/{id}` - Get genre details

2. **Publishers API**
    - `GET /publishers` - List all publishers
    - `GET /publishers/{id}` - Get publisher details

3. **Developers API**
    - `GET /developers` - List all developers
    - `GET /developers/{id}` - Get developer details

4. **Platforms API**
    - `GET /platforms` - List all platforms
    - `GET /platforms/{id}` - Get platform details

5. **Tags API**
    - `GET /tags` - List all tags
    - `GET /tags/{id}` - Get tag details

6. **Stores API**
    - `GET /stores` - List all stores
    - `GET /stores/{id}` - Get store details

7. **Additional Game API Endpoints**
    - `GET /games/{id}/achievements` - Game achievements
    - `GET /games/{id}/additions` - Game DLCs/editions

    - `GET /games/{id}/youtube` - YouTube videos

## Next Steps and Priorities

1. **Complete Phase 3: UI Components and Shared UI**
    - Start by implementing the core UI components
    - Set up the navigation system with deep linking
    - Create adaptive layouts for different platforms

2. **Begin Phase 4: Feature Implementation - Games**
    - Implement the games list views
    - Create a detailed game details page
    - Add search and filtering capabilities

3. **Proceed with Phase 5: Additional Features**
    - Implement genres functionality
    - Add developers and publishers sections
    - Create user features like favorites and settings

4. **Complete Phase 6: Optimization and Polishing**
    - Optimize performance for image loading and list scrolling
    - Add animations and transitions
    - Final testing and deployment preparation

## Development Workflow

1. Create the `develop` branch from `main`
2. Create feature branches for each specific feature from `develop`
3. Complete features one by one, merging back to `develop` when complete
4. Create release branches when a phase is complete
5. Test thoroughly before merging to `main`

Each feature should be fully tested and working before moving on to the next one. Focus on creating
maintainable, well-structured code with proper separation of concerns.

## Code Quality Standards

1. Follow SOLID principles
2. Maintain consistent code style across the project
3. Write unit tests for all repository and ViewModel classes
4. Document public APIs and complex functions
5. Use proper error handling throughout the application
6. Keep UI components reusable and composable
7. Ensure accessibility features are implemented

## Performance Targets

1. Fast app startup time (under 2 seconds)
2. Smooth scrolling in list views (60fps)
3. Quick image loading with placeholders
4. Efficient memory usage with proper resource disposal
5. Responsive UI across all supported platforms
6. Network bandwidth optimization with caching

By following this strategy, we will be able to complete all phases of the KMP Game Explorer project
efficiently while maintaining high code quality and performance standards.
